		<p>Newly Discovered Ore Deposit has been named “The Behemouth” by the crew, which I will use from now on in the
			record.</p>
		<p>Work on The Behemouth has begun but has to be cut short. Power supply to the new line of drills needs to be
			replaced.</p>
		<p>Faetherwatch transport for the processed gold never arrived today. Transport vehicles having an “unfixable
			mechanical problem” This is the 3rd time in the last month. Request sent for meeting with Faetherwatcher
			officials to discuss this issue. No more storage space in foundry to store finished gold. Wranjer crew
			enlisted to store gold in their station.</p>
