		<p>The Swarm returned. Proper procedures followed. Swarm broke through the blast door at the entrance to the
			shaft. Personnel describe the invasion as much larger than usual. After the invasion finished, ALL ore
			deposits completely cleared. I shit you not. The behemoth is completely gone. Lvl. 10 hallowed out. Entire
			mine was evacuated from fears of collapse. Level 10 now just a giant gaping hole. Measurements to be taken
			when it is deemed safe to do so.</p>

		<p>One Casualty during the invasion. Young Bill Brunfeld died from head injuries as a result of complications of
			trying to find cover. Flowers sent to Brunfeld household.</p>
